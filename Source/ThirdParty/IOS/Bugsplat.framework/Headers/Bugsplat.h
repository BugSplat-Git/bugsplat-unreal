 * IMPORTANT: For iOS, only one BugSplatAttachment is currently supported.
 * If BugSplatDelegate's method `- (BugSplatAttachment *)attachmentForBugSplat:(BugSplat *)bugSplat` returns a non-nil BugSplatAttachment,

 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * This method may be called multiple times, once per attribute+value pair.
 * Attributes are backed by an NSDictionary so attribute names must be unique.
 * If the attribute does not exist, it will be added to attributes dictionary.
 * If attribute already exists, the value will be replaced in the dictionary.
 * If attribute already exists, and the value is nil, the attribute will be removed from the dictionary.
 *
 * When this method is called, the following preprocessing occurs:
 * 1. attribute will first have white space and newlines removed from both the beginning and end of the String.
 *
 * 2. attribute will then be processed by an XML escaping routine which looks for escapable characters ",',&,<, and >
 * See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091945/what-characters-do-i-need-to-escape-in-xml-documents
 * Any XML comment blocks or CDATA blocks found will disable XML escaping within the block.
 *
 * 3. values will then be processed by an XML escaping routine which looks for escapable characters ",',&,<, and >
 * Any XML comment blocks or CDATA blocks found will disable XML escaping within the block.
 *
 * 4. After processing both attribute and value for XML escape characters, the attribute+value pair will be stored in an NSDictionary.
 *
 * If a crash occurs, attributes and values will be bundled up in a BugSplatAttachment as NSData, with a filename of CrashContext.xml, MIME type of "application/xml"
 * and encoding of "UTF-8". The attachment will be included with the crash data (except as noted above regarding iOS BugSplatAttachment limitation).
