## üëã Introduction

BugSplat's Unreal Editor plugin makes adding crash reporting to your game a breeze! With [BugSplat](https://bugsplat.com), you'll get a crash notification containing a full call stack with function names, line numbers, as well as many other invaluable insights into the issues tripping up your users.

Before diving into the plugin, please complete the following tasks:

* [Sign Up](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up) as a new BugSplat user
* Complete the [Welcome](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/welcome) workflow and make a note of your BugSplat database
* Review our [MyUnrealCrasher](https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/my-unreal-crasher) sample application to jump-start your evaluation of BugSplat

## üèó Installation 

You may choose to add BugSplat through the Unreal Marketplace or add the plugin to your Unreal project manually.

### Install from Marketplace

[Install BugSplat from the Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/bugsplat)

### Install Manually

1. Navigate to your project folder containing your `[ProjectName].uproject` file.
2. Create a `Plugins` folder if it does not already exist.
3. Create a `BugSplat` folder in the `Plugins` folder and copy the contents of this repo into the `BugSplat` folder.
4. In the Unreal Editor, ensure you can access the BugSplat plugin via `Edit > Project Settings` and scroll to the `BugSplat` section under `Plugins`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

BugSplat's Unreal plugin currently supports adding crash reporting to Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS games. With a few clicks, the BugSplat plugin can be configured to automatically upload symbol files so crash report stack traces display function names and line numbers.

To get started, generate a Client ID and Client Secret via the [Integrations](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/settings/database/integrations) page.

Next, open the BugSplat plugin menu in the Unreal Editor via `Edit > Project Settings`. Scroll to the `BugSplat` section of `Project Settings` and add values for `Database`, `Application`,  `Version`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret`:

<img width="1126" alt="BugSplat Unreal Plugin Settings" src="https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/bugsplat-unreal/assets/2646053/c386a288-31e7-475d-adb8-9bef0506272b">

### Windows, macOS, and Linux

BugSplat leverages Unreal's `CrashReportClient` to provide crash reporting for Windows, macOS, and Linux games. Be sure to update your project settings and enable `Include Crash Reporter` and `Include Debug Files in Shipping Builds`:

<img width="1126" alt="BugSplat Unreal Project Settings" src="https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/bugsplat-unreal/assets/2646053/55680b90-58fb-4afe-9169-a953f756f4d5">

To configure `CrashReportClient` to post to BugSplat, the `DataRouterUrl` value needs to be added to `DefaultEngine.ini`. The `bugsplat-unreal` plugin automatically updates the value for `DataRouterUrl` when the `Update Engine DefaultEngine.ini` option is enabled. Please note the `DataRouterUrl` value is global and is shared across all packaged builds created by the affected engine. To override the `DataRouterUrl` value a package build uses, you may optionally use the `Update Packaged Game INI` button under the `Tools` section.

In order to get function names and line numbers in crash reports, you'll need to upload your game's `.exe`, `.dll`, and `.pdb` files. To upload debug symbols for reach build, ensure that the `Enable Automatic Symbol Uploads` option is selected. When selected, a script to execute [symbol-upload](https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/symbol-upload) will be added to the `PostBuildSteps` field in `BugSplat.uplugin`. The symbol upload script will run automatically when your game is built.

### iOS and Android

Before attempting to use the BugSplat plugin to capture crashes on Mobile, please ensure you've completed the [iOS](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/setting-up-an-unreal-engine-project-for-ios/) and [Android](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/android-support-for-unreal-engine/) quickstart guides.

In order to get function names and line numbers in your iOS crash reports, please make the following changes in the `iOS` section of `Project Settings`.

| Option | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Generate dSYMs for code debugging and profiling| true |
| Generate dSYMs as a bundle for third-party crash tools | true |
| Support bitcode in shipping | false |

To enable crash reporting, ensure the `Enable iOS Crash Reporting` and `Enable Android Crash Reporting` options are selected. Also ensure that `Enable Automatic Symbol Uploads` is checked so that your crash reports contain function names and line numbers.

Note that sometimes iOS applications won't crash while the USB cable is connected. If this happens, disconnect the USB cable and re-run the application to trigger a crash.

### Xbox and PlayStation

BugSplat can provide instructions for implementing Unreal crash reporting on Xbox and PlayStation. Please email us at [support@bugsplat.com](mailto:support@bugsplat.com) for more info.

## üèÉ Usage

Once you've installed the plugin, add the following C++ snippet to your game to generate a sample crash.

```cpp
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Fatal, TEXT("BugSplat!"));
```

Run your application and submit a crash report.

On Desktops, submit a crash report via the Unreal CrashReportClient dialog that appears at crash time. We have developed a handy guide on how you can customize the Unreal CrashReportClient dialog that is available [here](https://www.bugsplat.com/blog/game-dev/customizing-unreal-engine-crash-dialog/). 

On iOS, after a crash occurs, restart the game and tap the `Send Report` option when prompted. On Android, crashes are submitted automatically at crash time.

Once you've submitted a crash report, navigate to the [Crashes](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/crashes) page. On the Crashes page, click the link in the ID column.

If everything is configured correctly, you should see something that resembles the following:
